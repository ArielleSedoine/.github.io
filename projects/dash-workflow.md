# Automated Multi-language MPEG-DASH Video Workflow (GCP)

## 📖 Overview
Implemented a fully automated multimedia pipeline in Google Cloud Platform to generate MPEG-DASH video streams with multi-language audio and subtitles.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python** (`google-cloud-storage`, `pubsub_v1`)
- **FFmpeg** (video/audio encoding for multi-resolution streams)
- **MP4Box (GPAC)** (muxing audio/subtitles, MPEG-DASH manifest generation)
- **Google Cloud Platform** (Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub)

## 📌 Key Achievements
- Successfully automated MPEG-DASH manifest generation with built-in multi-language support (audio and subtitles).
- Significantly optimized cloud processing time and reduced infrastructure costs.

## 🛠️ Technical Challenges Solved
- Precise handling of audio and subtitle metadata to ensure full MPEG-DASH compliance.
- Advanced debugging and optimization of FFmpeg and MP4Box commands.
